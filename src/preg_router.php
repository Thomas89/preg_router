 *
 * This is a simple regex router. It uses a dosini file for route definitions.
 * Each entry should look like:
 *
 *     [route name]
 *     pattern = "@/some/(pattern)/(\d+)@"
 *     handler = "SomeClass::some_method"
 *
 * Route name.
 * -----------
 * The route name must be unique.
 *
 * Pattern.
 * --------
 * The pattern gets fed into preg_match.
 *
 * Handler.
 * --------
 * The handler uses a syntax that suggests that it's a static method but,
 * thanks to some PHP ambiguity, it can be a static or instance method.
