/**
 * This is a simple regex router. It uses a dosini file for route definitions
 * or an array of arrays (passed to the constructor).
 *
 * Native array spec.
 * ==================
 * You can pass in an array of arrays. The first item in the nested array is
 * the pattern that gets passed to preg_match. The second item is the handler.
 * For example::
 *
 *     array(
 *         array('/foo/bar', 'Some::handler'),
 *         array('/bar/baz', 'Other::handler'),
 *     )
 *
 * Ini file spec.
 * ==============
 * Each entry should look like::
 *
 *     [route name]
 *     pattern = "@/some/(pattern)/(\d+)@"
 *     handler = "SomeClass::some_method"
 *
 * Route name.
 * -----------
 * The route name must be unique.
 *
 * Pattern.
 * --------
 * The pattern gets fed into preg_match.
 *
 * Handler.
 * --------
 * The handler is a function, instance method, or class method. The '::'
 * denotes a method.
